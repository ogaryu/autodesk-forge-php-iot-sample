First, to run the sample project, you need to setup Laravel development environment on your local machine.

## Laravel Installation

The Laravel framework has a few system requirements.  
The sample project is built for Laravel version 5.2 and this version requires PHP >= 5.9.  
It's highly recommended that you use Laravel Homestead virtual machine as your local development environment.

Laravel Homestead is a VagrantBox which is provided in Laravel official site.  
This is a virtual machine that all of these requirements are satisfied.  
Before launching Laravel Homestead environment, you must install VirtualBox or VMWare, and Vagrant on your local.  
Vagrant enables users to create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments.

To install and setup Laravel Homestead including Vagrant, please visit the following link.

[Laravel Homestead Installation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/homestead)

If you don't want to use Laravel Homestead, you need to install software separately; PHP, Web server(Apache), DB(MySQL), and Composer.  
You can also install XAMMP application.  
Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them.
